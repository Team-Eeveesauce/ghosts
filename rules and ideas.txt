rules of ghosts:
- no mechanic should need a tutorial to explain
- do not introduce too much at the same time
- nothing should make the game easier (unless its for accessibility purposes)


post-game ideas:
- after you finish the game, you can unlock a button that "crashes" the game and takes you to a fake desktop with minigames
- MINIGAME: click the ghosts 2, with cookie clicker minigame, health bars, and guns
- MINIGAME: visual novel sequence where you either romance the ghosts, or the ghosts summon a giant pointer to click YOU.
- MINIGAME: vvvvvv test, clearly work in progress
- MINIGAME: platformer with 3 levels and then it crashes with a fake gms error
- hidden lore and behind the scenes stuff
- instead of fixing the minion bug, acknowledge it in a todo text file.
- cheats menu, ability to toggle "epic graphics (experimental)" and backspace shortcut.
- gamemaker shortcut
- taskbar with shutdown option that actually closes the game
- every time you reopen the game you see the fake desktop
