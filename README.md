# Click The Ghosts
 A game about clicking ghosts, and "setting them free."

[Available on itch.io](https://englishguy4.itch.io/ghosts), password is `crazyghostpeepee`.

## What's it about?
Just the usual stuff.
- Player kills ghosts.
- Ghosts get upset.
- Player feels bad. (or at least they're supposed to, I'm no genius when it comes to storytelling.)

## How2Basic
The game is made in Gamemaker:Studio v1.4.9999, while the [switch port](https://github.com/Team-Eeveesauce/ghosts/tree/gms2) is made in Gamemaker Studio 2... I don't know which exact version, so let's just say the latest version.

Yes, we have a Switch port coming. Who is gonna play it? Nobody. But that's not the point.
