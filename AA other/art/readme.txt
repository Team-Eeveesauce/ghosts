====== Welcome ======
Yo, it's me. The singular person who does stuff at Team Eeveesauce.

I heard you liked the game. Or didn't. Maybe you haven't even played it yet.

But anyway, this folder contains all of the random stuff for Ghosts.
Art, music, the actual freaking source code itself. It's all in here.

===== File formats =====

png files can be opened in anything that can open image files. It's one of the most supported image formats, after all.
If you can find an image editor that *can't* open PNGs, I'll be surprised.

pdn files can be opened in Paint.Net, a free image editor for Windows.
It can be obtained from https://getpaint.net/ for Windows, or from the Microsoft Store for a small donation (of $11.95 AUD).

ceol files can be opened in Bosca Ceoil, a free and open-source music composing tool.
It can be obtained from https://boscaceoil.net/ on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

gmk files can be opened in Gamemaker: Studio, AKA the engine that the game runs on. Yes, this is the source code for the game.
Since GM:S is discontinued, I can't show you where to download it. Sorry, you're on your own for this one.

wav files can be opened in anything that can open music files. It's like the sound equivalent of a PNG.
I recommend VLC, which also happens to open pretty much every video and audio format ever.
